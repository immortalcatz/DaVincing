=== From the modder === 

It's been a while since I've played any mc or updated any mod. It turns out that I am not who I was when I started this mod, and Minecraft has changed a lot.

For a mod like this, you want you focus on what you can do and not on what the mod provids. I am not going to do very fast update releases on the main post. I will probably post some 'lab builds', but the main post is likely to remain on the most recent 'recommended' version.

Thank you for all players who cared, I will be around to make sure what I make is available, and I hope this mod gets played more.
